# Peavey Arduino Footswitch

This project inspired by http://www.claytonfelt.com/peavey-vypyr-vip-amp-diy-midi-footswitch/ and http://zorkmids.com/?p=1425  This footswitch controller is a very simple controller, both in logic and use.

The basic idea is you have 1 or more footswitches.  Let's say two for this
discussion.  The first footswitch changes between preset 0 and 1, and the 
second footswitch changes between preset 2 and 3.  The important part here
is, it remembers what each switch was at, so if you click switch 1 and then
switch 2, then switch 1 again, the state will be whatever switch 1 was
set to previously.  This just makes sense to me.  Maybe not to you.
